    <h1>Why Women Are Less Willing To Have Children Nowadays?</h1>

        <p>
            From 1950 to 2023, most countries experienced a significant reduction in women's fertility rates,
            with the majority seeing a relative decrease of 50% to 75%. 
            This decline is influenced by a range of social factors. For instance, in China,
            the percentage of people under 30 who didn't want children rose from 4.5% in 2019 to 9.5% just two years later. 
            I aim to investigate how changes in the roles of women affect fertility rates and their willingness to have children. 
            Understanding these factors can shed light on the complex interplay between societal shifts and individual choices regarding childbirth.

            Work-life conflict significantly affects fertility rates, as increased female labor force participation often 
            correlates with declining fertility. However, regional differences arise due to variations in development and the nature of working sectors. 
            Developed regions like Europe and North America exhibit lower fertility rates despite high workforce participation. This can result from inadequate 
            childcare and parental leave support. In contrast, Africa sees higher fertility rates with lower female labor participation, which reflects the  traditional 
            family structures and informal economic roles. Regions like Asia and South America show mixed patterns influenced by cultural and economic factors, 
            while Oceania demonstrates how balanced policies can mitigate work-life conflict.

        <h2>Education Attainment and Fertility Rate</h2>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>
            Regions with higher educational attainment generally exhibit lower fertility rates, 
            For instance, countries like the United States, with 13.4 average years of education, have a fertility rate of 1.67, 
            reflecting this inverse trend. Conversely, regions with smaller bubbles (lower educational attainment) tend to have higher 
            fertility rates, evident in their darker-colored circles. In developed countries, women's increasing emphasis on career development
            plays a significant role in reducing their willingness to have children. Higher levels of education and professional 
            opportunities often lead to delayed marriage and childbearing, as women prioritize establishing their careers and achieving financial stability.

            Japan, Spain, South Korea, and Singapore stand out as the countries with highest workforce engagement(more than 50%) and lowest birth rates(less than 1.5). 
            This trend underscores the profound impact of work-life conflict, where the pressures of balancing professional ambitions with family r
            esponsibilities leave many women less inclined to have children.

        <p>
            The fertility rates of Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and Canadahave have fallen below 1.5, 
            coupled with women attaining more than 12 years of education. This shows the link between higher education levels and declining birth rates. 
            As women pursue advanced education, they often delay starting families, prioritizing personal and professional growth. 
            This trend reflects how educational attainment reshapes life priorities, often reducing the willingness to have children.
